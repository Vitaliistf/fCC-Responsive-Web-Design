            <h2>Here is some info about Chester:</h2>
            <div class="info-group">
                <h3>Early acts</h3>
                <p>Bennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends?, and together they
                    released an eponymous three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a
                    post-grunge band called Grey Daze. The band recorded a demo in 1993 and two albums: Wake Me in 1994,
                    and ...No Sun Today in 1997. Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998.</p>

                <h3>Linkin Park</h3>
                <p>Bennington performing with Linkin Park at the 2009 Sonisphere Festival
                    Bennington had been frustrated and nearly quit his musical career altogether until Jeff Blue, the
                    vice president of A&R at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future members
                    of Linkin Park (then known as Xero). He quit his day job at a digital services firm and traveled to
                    California for the audition, in which he successfully won a place in the band. He left his own
                    birthday party early to record his audition. Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band's other vocalist,
                    made significant progress together but failed to find a record deal and faced numerous rejections.
                    Blue, who had since become vice president of A&R at Warner Records, intervened again to help the
                    band sign with the label.
                <p>
                <p>On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album, Hybrid Theory, through Warner Records.
                    Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to Hybrid Theory based on some early material. Shinoda
                    characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as
                    "everyday emotions you talk about and think about". Bennington later described the songwriting
                    experience to Rolling Stone magazine in early 2002, "It's easy to fall into that thing â€“ 'poor, poor
                    me', that's where songs like 'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about
                    taking responsibility for your actions. I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm the
                    reason that I feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me down."</p>
                <p>Bennington was Linkin Park's primary lead vocalist, but he occasionally shared the role with Shinoda.
                    All Music Guide described Bennington's vocals as "higher-pitched" and "emotional", in contrast to
                    Shinoda's hip-hop-style delivery. Both members also worked together to write lyrics for the band's
                    songs.</p>
                <p>Hybrid Theory (2000) was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005. The band's second album, Meteora
                    (2003), reached number one on the Billboard 200 album chart, as did its third album, Minutes to
                    Midnight (2007). Linkin Park has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide. In 2003, MTV2 named
                    Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium.
                    Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In 2012, the band was
                    voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.</p>

                <h3>Dead by Sunrise</h3>
                <p>In 2005, Bennington co-founded Dead by Sunrise, an electronic rock band from Los Angeles, California,
                    with Orgy and Julien-K members Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck. Dead by Sunrise made their live debut in
                    May 2008, performing at the 13th anniversary party for Club Tattoo in Tempe, Arizona.</p>

                <p>The band released their lone album, Out of Ashes, on October 13, 2009.</p>
